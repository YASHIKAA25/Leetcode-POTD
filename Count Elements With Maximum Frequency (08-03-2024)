//Complexity
//Time complexity: O(n)
//Space complexity: O(1)

//cpp code

//Method:
//1) Set up variables for the maximum frequency (maxFreq) and answer (ans), and create an array count to hold the count of each number.
//2) Increase the count of each number in the count array as you iterate through the input array. 
//3) Determine the count array's maximum frequency for each and every number. 
//4) Repeatedly iterate through the input array, counting the integers with the highest frequency. 
//5) Provide the number count that has the highest frequency.

        for (int num : nums) count[num]++;
        for (int num : count) maxFreq = max(maxFreq, num);        
        for (int num : nums) if (maxFreq == count[num]) ans++;
