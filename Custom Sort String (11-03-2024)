//cpp code
//Approach:
//1) Create an empty string at the beginning to hold the sorted characters. 
//2) Set up a vector to hold the character frequency at initialization. 
//3) Determine how often each character appears in the supplied string s. 
//4) Sort the characters according to the 'order' string. 
//5) Fill in the 'custom' string with characters in the 'order' supplied. 
//6) Process the remaining characters that weren't in the string 'order'. 
//7) Give me the sorted string back.
