//Explanation:
//1) The class Solution with a public member function lengthOfLastWord, which takes a string s as input and returns an integer (the length of the last word).
//2) It initializes an integer variable pos to the index of the last character in the string s.
//3) The while loop moves the pos backwards until it finds the first non-space character or reaches the beginning of the string.
//4) It initializes an integer variable result to store the length of the last word.
//5) The while loop continues moving pos backwards and increments result until it finds a space character (indicating the end of the last word) or reaches the beginning of the string.
//6) Finally, it returns the value of result, which represents the length of the last word in the given string.

//cpp code

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int pos = s.size() - 1;
        while(pos >= 0 && s[pos] == ' ') pos--;

        int result = 0;
        while(pos >= 0 && s[pos] != ' ') {
            pos--;
            result++;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
