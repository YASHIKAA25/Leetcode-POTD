//Approach:
//1) Set up a variable time to keep track of the overall time taken. 
//2) If the person at position k hasn't purchased all of their tickets, iterate through the queue and allow each person to purchase a ticket. Then, update the queue by decrementing the number of tickets for the person who purchased a ticket. Finally, increment the time by 1 second for each pass.
//3) Return the total time taken.

//cpp code

class Solution {
public:
    int timeRequiredToBuy(vector<int>& tickets, int k) {
        int total = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < tickets.size(); ++i) {
            if (i <= k) {
                total += min(tickets[i], tickets[k]);
            } else {
                total += min(tickets[i], tickets[k] - 1);
            }
        }
